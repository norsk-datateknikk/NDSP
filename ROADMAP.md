# Roadmap

## Numerics

- [ ] implement FFT from both real and complex vectors, ad-hoc twiddle factor calculation.
- [ ] implement FFT from both real and complex vectors, precomputation of twiddle factor.

## IO

- [ ] load from hdf5.
- [ ] store to hdf5.

## Usability

- [ ] Implement a simplified plotting interface/example.
- [ ] Implement an easy way of generating a simple vector.
- [ ] Consider adding from_string method to simplify test-writing.
