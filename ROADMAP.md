# Roadmap

## Numerics

- [x] implement FFT from complex vectors, ad-hoc twiddle factor calculation.
- [x] implement IFFT from complex vectors, ad-hoc twiddle factor calculation.
- [ ] implement FFT from complex vectors, precomputation of twiddle factor.
- [ ] implement IFFT from complex vectors, precomputation of twiddle factor.

- [ ] implement WGN for real vectors.

## IO

- [ ] load from hdf5.
- [ ] store to hdf5.
- [ ] load from binary.
- [ ] store to binary.

## Usability

- [~] Implement a simplified plotting interface/example.
- [ ] Consider adding from_string method to simplify test-writing.
